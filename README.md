# Horiseon's Code Refractor

## Description:
I was asked to refactor an existing code of Horiseon's website. I was supposed to do accomplish the following:

- Add semantic HTML elements
- Make sure all HTML elements follow a structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Have a codebase that follows an accessibility standards; adding alt on images and icons.
- Heading attributes should fall in sequential order
- It should have a descriptive Title.
- Fix any link that isn't working.
